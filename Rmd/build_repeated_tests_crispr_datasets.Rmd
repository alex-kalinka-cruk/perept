# Overview

The overall goal is to develop a set of standard repeated-tests CRISPR datasets that can be used in conjunction with the Maximum Likelihood estimates of false-positive and false-negative rates (implemented in the R package `perept`) to compare the performance of algorithm changes for the AZ-CRUK CRISPR analysis pipeline.

Three data sources will be used:

1. HT29 essentiality screens performed at Sanger.
2. EGFR treatment-control screens performed at AZ.
3. Veneto... treatment-control screen.

The HT29 data is not ideal as they are essentiality screens and the effect sizes will be large and not so relevant to drug treatment screens. However, there are a lot of replicates potentially providing power for discriminating the performance of different algorithms.

While the drug screens (2 and 3) are ideal screen types, they have very few replicates and will require sub-sampling of sgRNAs to create pseudo-replicates (respecting screen and sample origins). This is not ideal as it creates dependencies between the tests.

# HT29 essentiality screens provided by Francesco Iorio (Sanger)

One downside is that only two sets of plasmid counts (named `ERS717283.plasmid` and `CRISPR_C6596666.sample`) are used throughout the screens which undermines the independence between different tests. The other is that the Yusa v1 sgRNA library has been used, instead of v2.

```{r}
path_ht29 <- file.path(data_root,"ht29-francesco-iorio","01_Counts assembled")
# Assemble the sgRNAs, genes, and the two plasmid count replicates.
c903 <- read.table(file.path(path_ht29,"HT29_c903.tsv"), stringsAsFactors = F, header=T)
c905 <- read.table(file.path(path_ht29,"HT29_c905.tsv"), stringsAsFactors = F, header=T)
common <- data.frame(c903[,1:3],c905$CRISPR_C6596666.sample)
colnames(common)[3:4] <- c("plasmid.1","plasmid.2")
c904 <- read.table(file.path(path_ht29,"HT29_c904.tsv"), stringsAsFactors = F, header=T)
c906 <- read.table(file.path(path_ht29,"HT29_c906.tsv"), stringsAsFactors = F, header=T)
c907 <- read.table(file.path(path_ht29,"HT29_c907.tsv"), stringsAsFactors = F, header=T)
c908 <- read.table(file.path(path_ht29,"HT29_c908.tsv"), stringsAsFactors = F, header=T)
```

```{r}
